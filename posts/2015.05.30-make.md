# Building Software with Make

I've recently had one of my longer blog posts published by Smashing Magazine. 

The article was called "[Building Software with Make](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/building-web-applications-with-make/)", which attempts to demonstrate how Make - an automation/orchestration tool - can be used in place of other modern build tools such as Grunt or Gulp.

I aim to help strengthen your understanding of Make and its ability to use the terminal/shell environment.
