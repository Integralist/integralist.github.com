# Developer Tools

I don't know who needs to hear this but:
**I love my developer tools**.

## Core

- **Package Manager**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- **Terminal**: [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)
- **Code Editor**: [Neovim](https://neovim.io)

**HISTORY:**\
I was using a multiplexer ([tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)) for years but colour issues forced me to switch to [Zellij](https://zellij.dev). I then switched from [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) and Zellij to using Warp as my terminal (helping to consolidate the number of tools I needed to install and configure) as Warp provided a lot of what I was using Zellij for. My switch to Warp also meant I could drop support for [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README.md) as Warp provided fuzzy searching my history, while `fd` (see below) allowed me to easily locate files. But after a year of using Warp I moved to [ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/ghostty) and back to using `fzf` (as it's just so awesome). I then used the 'split pane' feature in Ghostty while using the built-in floating terminal in Neovim for project-by-project development (which was better than a single hotkey overlay terminal that Warp provided, as I wasn't interested in going back to a multiplexer like tmux or zellij).

> † I had switched to [Bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/blob/master/README.md) but `htop` is just so much more flexible and configurable, and although the graphs in `btm` are nice I just don't _need_ them.

## Browser

Controversial, but I had started to move away from [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) with a whole suite of security/privacy minded tools to [Apple's Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) browser.

I _was_ using Safari's ["Tab Group"](https://twitter.com/integralist/status/1514526555275501569?s=20&t=BJu3WlWq6dhoeAarJf91ig) feature, which I _really_ liked along with the following extensions...

- AdBlock One
- Dark Reader for Safari
- SimplyJSON for Safari
- Super Agent for Safari (Cookie Consent Automation)

...but ultimately the Tab Groups feature ended up being super buggy and duplicating bookmarks and groups etc and I couldn't get the issue resolved, so I ended up back with Google Chrome.
