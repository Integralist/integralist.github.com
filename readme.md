Decided to move my website off of the blogging platform tumblr and just host it directly from GitHub.

The site uses Media Queries to create a responsive design.

Originally this repo was using a GitHub JavaScript API wrapper library to pull in loads of data, but I've since scrapped that idea and just hard-coded only the repos of interest and linked my blog posts directly to the relevant Markdown files also hosted on GitHub.

Simple.
