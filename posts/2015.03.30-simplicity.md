# Designing for Simplicity

I've recently had one of my longer blog posts published by David Walsh (Mozilla Developer responsible for the Mozilla Developer Network front-end) on his own site. 

The article was called "[Designing for Simplicity](http://davidwalsh.name/designing-simplicity)", which covered a lot of topics such as infrastructure and architecture design patterns, scalability, functional programming, CAP theorem, Docker and containerization.
