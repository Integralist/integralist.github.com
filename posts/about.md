# About Me

<img src="../images/profile.jpg" class="profile">

Hi there, my name is Mark and I currently work at the BBC as the technical lead/principal web developer for their responsive news frameworks team. Our goal is to move BBC News (and related products) from their current stack to a cloud based infrastructure.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/integralist) and [GitHub](https://github.com/integralist) talking about different technical subjects:

- OOP and FP
- Clojure, Go, Ruby and other languages
- Problems around concurrency and distributed systems

I'm a published author of two books (both through Apress):

- [Pro Vim](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-Vim-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484202511/ref=sr_1_1)
- [tmux Taster](http://www.amazon.co.uk/tmux-Taster-Mark-McDonnell-ebook/dp/B00OPTU7LY/ref=sr_1_1)

My colleagues at BBC News found me fit to win the following awards:

- Best Public Relations of 2014
- Most innovative use of Technology 2014 (team award)
- Developer of the Year 2013
