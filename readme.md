GitHub Repos/Gists
===

Description
---

This project demonstrates how to use a JavaScript wrapper around the GitHub REST API (v2) to pull in your repos (both owned by you or watched by you as well as your gists).

This project mainly uses...

* [when.js](https://github.com/briancavalier/when.js) for Deferred/Promises
* [RequireJs](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs) for handling of AMD modules

â€¦along with other AMD modules I've written.

It's completely JavaScript based so lack of js means this project croaks, but if you're not fussed about SEO or lack of js then this is a good way of creating a mini-resume/cv for the more technically minded potential employees (I know that when I'm recruiting for new developers that I ask whether the candidate has an active GitHub account - says a lot about them).
