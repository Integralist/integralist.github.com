      <description>Introduction Types of Monitoring Does it work? What metrics should we focus on? Frequency and Aggregation Data Collection Methods Frontend Monitoring Logging or Metrics? What else to check for? Conclusion  
Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished reading Practical Monitoring &amp;ldquo;Effective Strategies for the Real World&amp;rdquo; by Mike Julian. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book and highly recommended.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on monitoring, based on both my past experience on the subject and also some interesting details found in Practical Monitoring.</description>

      <description>In software engineering, there is a lot of confusion caused by the discussion around what exactly is meant by the word &amp;ldquo;observability&amp;rdquo; and how it relates to other words, such as &amp;ldquo;monitoring&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;instrumentation&amp;rdquo;.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to take a quick look at the definitions of these words and see if we can understand them without having to read through a 10,000 word essay on the finer details of the topic. This isn&amp;rsquo;t that blog post.</description>
