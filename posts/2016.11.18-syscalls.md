# Syscalls and C

I've created a quick gist to explain the difference between a system call (provided by the Linux kernal) and a wrapper function that has a similar name within one of the C standard libraries, you can find it here:

I have no formal Computer Science (CS) background, and I'm only now (16yrs into my career) starting to learn the C programming language in order to help give me a deeper knowledge of how *nix systems work and other core CS concepts.
