      <description>Logs? Levels Quality  
Logs? Applications should record information/events to help make debugging (and understanding) what a program is doing easier.
Typically this information is recorded into a log file.
But in some cases it is preferred to send this information to stdout because it then becomes the responsibility of the operating system/environment to determine where and how those logs are stored.
To quote 12factor:
 A (service) never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream.</description>
