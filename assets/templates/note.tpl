## Watch along notes

I approach all my reviews with a genuinely open mind—sarcasm aside. My goal is
always to go in thinking, _This is going to be awesome. I’m going to love
watching this_. Too often, reviewers come in with preconceived notions, shaped by
their memories of the event or the internet’s latest take on it, and that bias
seeps into their analysis. But really, these events deserve to be revisited with
the same excitement we had as kids—focusing on what made us fall in love with
wrestling in the first place. I do my best to suspend disbelief, though I’ll
admit, I have my “smart mark” moments too.
