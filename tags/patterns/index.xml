      <description>This post was originally written for David Walsh back in 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ve since decided to reproduce it here for my own records - Integralist: August, 2017.
 Before we get started, it&amp;rsquo;s worth me spending a brief moment introducing myself to you. My name is Mark (or @integralist if Twitter happens to be your communication tool of choice) and I currently work for BBC News in London England as a principal engineer/tech lead; and I&amp;rsquo;m also the author of &amp;ldquo;Pro Vim&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Model View Controller  Mixed definitions  God Controller Problems Skinny Controller  Presenters?  What problem are Presenters trying to solve? How do they work?  Code Example  Controller View Presenter  Conclusion  
Introduction Model, View, Controller (MVC). This is a pretty standard architectural pattern and has been in use when developing software since the early 1970&amp;rsquo;s.
The basic principle of the pattern is to separate the different areas of logic from your application into distinct compartments.</description>
