            <p>Welcome to WrestleMania 3, where the WWF cranked up the drama, threw in some outrageous characters, and had Hulk Hogan bodyslam a mountain (well, technically a giant). Taking place on March 29, 1987, at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan, this event was so colossal that it made <em>actual</em> news, because when you pack over 93,000 fans into a stadium to watch sweaty dudes throw each other around, it's kind of a big deal.</p>
            <p>But WrestleMania 3 wasn't just about sheer size—it was about pure spectacle, larger-than-life personalities, and storylines juicier than a summer blockbuster. From love triangles to French giants with back problems, let’s break down the madness that was WrestleMania 3.</p>
            <h2>The Lead-Up: Soap Operas, But With Muscle</h2>
            <p>Before we dive into the body slams and elbow drops, let’s talk about the build-up. The WWF was in full gear, crafting storylines with more twists than a pretzel factory. We had betrayals, long-standing feuds, and, of course, a whole lot of yelling.</p>
            <h3>1. <strong>Hogan vs. Andre: "The Bigger They Are..."</strong></h3>
            <p>Let’s start with the big one—literally. Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant. They were best buddies for years, just two dudes hanging out, slapping each other on the back like old pals do. Then one fateful day, Bobby "The Brain" Heenan slithered his way into Andre's ear, convincing him that Hogan was hogging all the glory. So what does Andre do? He rips Hogan's shirt off on <em>Piper's Pit</em> and officially goes from gentle giant to disgruntled behemoth. Hogan was shook. This was a friendship-ending offense, people. The match was set, and the world waited to see if Hulkamania could overcome Andre’s towering figure and... questionable back health.</p>
            <h3>2. <strong>Macho Man vs. Ricky Steamboat: "How Many Times Can One Man Be Throttled?"</strong></h3>
            <p>Oh, the Randy Savage and Ricky Steamboat saga! This one featured some legit trauma—Steamboat got his throat crushed by Savage with a ring bell during a match, because apparently that’s what friends do in the WWF. Steamboat had to heal up, and when he did, he came back thirstier for revenge than a man at a buffet. Savage, meanwhile, strutted around with Miss Elizabeth, defending his Intercontinental Championship with all the crazed intensity you'd expect from a man who yells like his mouth is full of gravel.</p>
            <h3>3. <strong>Hair on the Line: Piper vs. Adonis</strong></h3>
            <p>Rowdy Roddy Piper and "Adorable" Adrian Adonis had one of the strangest storylines at WrestleMania 3—fueled by clashing fashion senses and bad haircuts. Piper, who was supposedly retiring (spoiler alert: he didn’t), was tired of Adonis’ overly pink persona and his notorious "Flower Shop" segments. So what better way to settle their differences than by a Hair vs. Hair match? Loser gets their head shaved. Clearly, this was top-tier drama.</p>
            <h2>The Matches: Slam Fests, Haircuts, and Drama!</h2>
            <p>Now, onto the meat of the event—<em>the matches</em>.</p>
            <h3>1. <strong>The Can-Am Connection vs. Bob Orton and The Magnificent Muraco</strong></h3>
            <p>This was the opening match of the night, and let’s be real—people were still filing in and getting their popcorn. But the Can-Am Connection, composed of Rick Martel and Tom Zenk, brought the energy with high-flying moves that made people think, "Hey, maybe this wrestling stuff is kinda cool." They won, of course, setting the crowd up for what would be an absurdly entertaining night.</p>
            <h3>2. <strong>Hercules vs. Billy Jack Haynes</strong></h3>
            <p>The "Battle of the Full Nelson." You know a match is serious when it’s built entirely around who can squeeze the other guy’s head better. Neither man tapped out, but Hercules whacked Haynes with a chain post-match just to prove a point. No one really won here, but we did learn that a metal chain is stronger than a Full Nelson. Valuable life lesson.</p>
            <h3>3. <strong>King Kong Bundy and Midget Mania</strong></h3>
            <p>Bundy, who was about the size of a small car, teamed up with some "little people" wrestlers against Hillbilly Jim and his tiny partners. But Bundy, ever the opportunist, decided to squash one of the little guys instead of focusing on Hillbilly Jim. The match was weird, a little uncomfortable, and mostly just an excuse to get Bundy back on TV after being humiliated by Hogan the previous year.</p>
            <h3>4. <strong>Harley Race vs. Junkyard Dog</strong></h3>
            <p>In the "Loser Must Bow" match, Harley Race, King of the Ring, faced the ever-popular Junkyard Dog. If Junkyard lost, he had to bow to Harley Race, which, let’s be honest, was not his style. Race won (thanks to some shenanigans from Bobby Heenan), but Junkyard Dog wasn’t about to bow for anyone—so he smacked Race with a chair instead. The crowd loved it, because who doesn’t like a good ol’ fashioned chair shot?</p>
            <h3>5. <strong>"Rowdy" Roddy Piper vs. Adrian Adonis</strong></h3>
            <p>Piper’s "retirement" match was a Hair vs. Hair match against Adonis, a man who took the word "flamboyant" to new heights with his overly pink outfits and perfume-spraying antics. Adonis had a plan, but Piper had a pair of clippers waiting for him. Piper won, and the iconic image of Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake shaving Adonis' head was seared into wrestling history. Piper left the ring to a hero’s sendoff, but don't worry—he came back, because <em>nobody</em> stays retired in wrestling.</p>
            <h3>6. <strong>The British Bulldogs & Tito Santana vs. The Hart Foundation & Danny Davis</strong></h3>
            <p>The Bulldogs and Santana were out for revenge after the dastardly referee-turned-wrestler Danny Davis helped the Harts steal their titles. Davis, who could barely throw a punch, was protected by his partners throughout the match, but in true weasel fashion, he scored the pin, which is both infuriating and impressive. This match kept the Bulldogs-Hart Foundation feud alive, setting the stage for years of future clashes.</p>
            <h3>7. <strong>Randy "Macho Man" Savage vs. Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat</strong></h3>
            <p>The match that stole the show. Savage vs. Steamboat was a clinic in technical wrestling, high spots, and sheer storytelling. Steamboat, with his vengeful dragon energy, outmaneuvered Savage in what is still considered one of the best wrestling matches <em>ever</em>. After 20 insane minutes of back-and-forth, Steamboat won the Intercontinental Championship, sending Savage into a spiral that eventually made him even <em>more</em> of a megastar. This match was like if Shakespeare wrote a wrestling bout and added 20 flying elbow drops.</p>
            <h3>8. <strong>Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant</strong></h3>
            <p>And now, the main event. The unstoppable force meets the immovable object. Hulk Hogan was defending his WWF Championship against the 7'4", 520-pound Andre, who had never been defeated. The match wasn’t exactly a technical masterpiece, but it didn’t need to be—this was all about spectacle. The moment when Hogan slammed Andre became the stuff of legend. Hogan somehow overcame the Giant (and his dodgy knees), pinning him after the leg drop heard 'round the world. Hulkamania ran wild, brother.</p>
            <h2>The Aftermath: Legacies Built on Slammed Giants and Shaved Heads</h2>
            <p>WrestleMania 3 cemented several legacies. Hogan became an icon for bodyslamming Andre, even though Andre probably needed help getting out of bed the next morning. Savage and Steamboat's match set the bar for in-ring excellence, leading to future classics. And Piper, well, he would retire and then come back about 57 more times.</p>
            <p>But the true legacy of WrestleMania 3? It showed that wrestling wasn’t just a niche thing for sweaty gymnasiums—it was a global spectacle with larger-than-life characters that made you believe anything was possible. Even bodyslamming a Giant.</p>
