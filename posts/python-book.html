<h1>Python for Programmers (new book)</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve done it again, I&#39;ve written another book.</p>

<p>OK so it&#39;s a short one, but it&#39;s been really enjoyable as it&#39;s been mainly me documenting my experience as a programmer learning a new language and all the tools and idioms that come with the new territory. In this case it&#39;s the Python eco-system.</p>

<h2>Why write another book?</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been working with Ruby for the last ~4yrs and Go for a year or so now, and jumping into Python has been a real pleasure and breath of fresh air. Plus the similarties in language are more towards Go than they are Ruby; so if you&#39;ve been considering learning Python but wasn&#39;t sure what the point was, then I strongly recommend you give it a whirl as I&#39;ve found myself enjoying it a lot more than Ruby (not because it&#39;s fresh, but because as I&#39;ve grown older and become - thankfully - wiser I&#39;ve realised some of the inherent issues with Ruby that Python solves through simplicity; much like Go&#39;s ethos is based upon).</p>

<p>But enough rambling, what about the book? It&#39;s called &quot;Python for Programmers&quot; and it&#39;s aimed at developers who don&#39;t need a lesson in how to write code but just want to get up to speed with the Python language and all the idioms and tools etc.</p>

<h2>Where can I get it?</h2>

<p>You can find the book here: <a href="https://leanpub.com/pythonforprogrammers/">https://leanpub.com/pythonforprogrammers/</a></p>

<p>Go check it out, and for what is effectively £5, you get a lot of concise useful knowledge bombs dropped within a short space of time and will genuinely help you get up to speed - in a practical sense - in no time at all. For the time I&#39;ve spent on the book, and the usefulness I think it provides, I wouldn&#39;t expect £5 (which is ~$8) to be a stretch for most people in our industry; especially considering our knowledge is what gets us paid, so educating ourselves is important to our professional growth.</p>

<p>Give it a spin and let me know what you think.</p>
