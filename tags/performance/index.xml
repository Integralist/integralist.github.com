      <description>Introduction Information vs Data Watch out for misleading data Frequency Pie Chart Bar Chart  Stacked Split  Histograms  Differences? Calculating dimensions Frequency Density?  Line Graphs  
Introduction I started learning about statistics because I found myself doing a lot of operational monitoring (i.e. making systems more observable, instrumenting individual services, and monitoring that data via custom built dashboards).

      <description>Introduction Ephemeral Channels? Fail quickly Verify your message handling logic Be wary of global variables Instrument timers around your primary message handler Pynsq doesnâ€™t support coroutines Prevent messages backing up in the queue Avoid API libraries auto-retrying expensive operations Place blocking IO operations into a thread pool Rate limit yourself Disable yourself Drop or Requeue?  
Introduction This post should serve as a guide for best practices when dealing with services that consume messages from queues and process those messages (we refer to them as QRs or &amp;lsquo;Queue Readers&amp;rsquo;).</description>

      <description>Introduction Use real datasets Identify collateral damage Stub services if necessary Distribute your traffic Automate for reproducible runs Consider disabling authentication Don&amp;rsquo;t immediately scale dependencies Send traffic from different geographical regions Decide if your tool should support reusing connections Start testing a single instance, before moving onto clusters Verify load using multiple strategies Reset your environment between test runs Document the results Tools
