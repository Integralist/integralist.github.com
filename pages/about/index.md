# About Classic WWF

<p class="strapline">Why is this even a thing?</p>

## History

I've been a fan of wrestling for as long as I can remember.

I started watching around 1987.

Somewhere around 1995 I stopped (it was getting too cheesy for me as a
teenager).

I completely slept on the Attitude era (doh) and started watching again in the
year 2000.

I then dropped out again around 2003 / 2004 and I've not gone back since.

## Best Years?

For me the best years were 1987 to 1992 (1990 probably being peak fandom).

I rewatch 1987 to 1990 the most.

In 2024 I got access to every episode of [WWF Prime Time][prime time], [WWF
Wrestling Challenge][wrestling challenge] and [WWF Superstars or
Wrestling][superstars] (the latter being the hardest to find) and I've been
watching each episode across each show in chronological order. That has been
such a joy as I get to relive my youth.
