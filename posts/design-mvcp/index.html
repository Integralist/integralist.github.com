<h1 id="mvcp-model-view-controller-presenter">MVCP: Model, View, Controller, Presenter</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Model, View, Controller (MVC). This is a pretty standard architectural pattern and has been in use when developing software since the early 1970&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The basic principle of the pattern is to separate the different areas of logic from your application into distinct compartments.</p>

<h3 id="model">Model</h3>

<p>The model holds your business data. Typically this will be data that is pulled in from a database or external data service of some kind.</p>

<h3 id="view">View</h3>

<p>The view is your user interface. This is what the client will interact with when using your application.</p>

<h3 id="controller">Controller</h3>

<p>The controller is the boss. He sits at the top and delegates responsibilities to either the view or the model.</p>

<h2 id="mixed-definitions">Mixed definitions</h2>

<p>There seems to be a dispute in the dev community regarding how the responsibilities should be divided.</p>

<p>Some feel a &lsquo;fat controller&rsquo; principle is best (where by the controller tells the model not only <em>when</em> but <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> it should get its data).</p>

<p>My understanding of the pattern is that it was designed so that the Controller stays &lsquo;skinny&rsquo;. It may be the boss, but like most good bosses it doesn&rsquo;t try and stay in control. It knows the best team member for the job at hand and delegates accordingly.</p>

<p>This is also good code design because the Controller doesn&rsquo;t have too much <em>context</em> (i.e. it doesn&rsquo;t know everything, which means it&rsquo;ll be easier to maintain and scale).</p>

<h3 id="god-controller">God Controller</h3>

<p>There are a few ways we can implement an MVC pattern, one is known as the &lsquo;God Controller&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This is where a single Controller exists and it oversees everything no matter what was requested by the client.</p>

<p>For example, the single Controller would be passed the request from the client (usually handled by a custom routing application, and most frameworks will provide their own).</p>

<p>The Controller would determine what type of request was made (if the request was for a &lsquo;contact&rsquo; page then it&rsquo;ll make a request for the Contact model, or if the request was for the &lsquo;about&rsquo; page then it&rsquo;ll make a request for the About model).</p>

<p>Once it knows the type of request it&rsquo;ll proceed to get the relevant model data and assign it to some View variables and render the required View.</p>

<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>

<p>Now there are two problems with this implementation:</p>

<ol>
<li>maintainability</li>
<li>scalability</li>
</ol>

<p>As mentioned before, this comes down to bad code design. The &lsquo;God Controller&rsquo; knows too much and tries to do too much. Once you start getting above a few different types of requests you&rsquo;ll start to understand what a mess the code can become by having multiple branches for different routing scenarios.</p>

<p>I work as an engineer for the BBC News team in London and we had suffered from this exact set-up (hence the lessons the team has learnt and improved upon are the reason why I&rsquo;m able to write this post for you now).</p>

<h3 id="skinny-controller">Skinny Controller</h3>

<p>There is another approach we can take which is known as the &lsquo;skinny controller&rsquo; approach.</p>

<p>The way it works is that a request will come into the application and will get passed to a page specific Controller.</p>

<p>The page specific Controller will call the relevant Model and will assign the returned data to a few View variables.</p>

<p>The Controller will then render a View and pass through the variables into the View for it to use.</p>

<p>As you can see, this isn&rsquo;t that different from the &lsquo;God Controller&rsquo; with the exception that the Routing part of the application now will have extra logic which determines which specific Controller should be loaded. This is a better situation to be in because you&rsquo;re making your code base both more maintainable and scalable.</p>

<p>Note: as I mentioned in the previous section, BBC News had a sort of &lsquo;God Controller&rsquo; issue and our first step to resolving the problem was to take a similar approach as described above (i.e. to start creating page specific Controllers). That was a good first step.</p>

<p>The next step from here was to separate out our logic even further by implementing Presenters, and it was our tech lead at BBC News (<a href="http://twitter.com/jcleveley" target="_blank">John Cleveley</a>) who made that decision which resulted in a much more efficient, maintainable and scalable code base.</p>

<h2 id="presenters">Presenters</h2>

<h3 id="what-problem-are-presenters-trying-to-solve">What problem are Presenters trying to solve?</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine we&rsquo;ve gone for the &lsquo;Skinny Controller&rsquo; approach. There are still some inherent issues…</p>

<p>First of all, our Controller can still have too much context and be handling more information than it should.</p>

<p>But also, and more importantly, you may find there is still a lot of duplication of code across your Controllers.</p>

<p>The reasoning for this is that if you consider the structure of a web page/application you&rsquo;ll notice that it is typically made up of unique &lsquo;features&rsquo;. For example, if you&rsquo;re displaying your tweets on a page then that&rsquo;s a unique feature.</p>

<p>Each feature must be able to stand on its own. We normally describe these features as being &lsquo;components&rsquo;. Each component can be loaded whenever and wherever needed. Having a component based architecture allows your code base to become more modular and reusable.</p>

<p>For example the navigation menu on a page could be considered a &lsquo;component&rsquo;. Also, the navigation menu component is likely going to need to appear on every single page of the application.</p>

<p>So, if you&rsquo;re splitting up your logic into page specific Controllers then it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;re still repeating code across the Controllers to handle the loading of re-occurring components such as the navigation (e.g. pulling its data from a navigation Model and setting View variables etc).</p>

<p>Now there are ways that this code repetition can be avoided, and one such way is to use the concept of Presenters.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-they-work">How do they work?</h3>

<p>Presenters (like everything in software engineering) can be implemented in many different ways.</p>

<p>For example, at BBC News we initially were manually creating new Presenter instances within our page Controllers. But the team here are quite clever chaps (especially <a href="http://twitter.com/kenturamon" target="_blank">Robert Kenny</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/sthulb" target="_blank">Simon Thulbourn</a>) and they realised that this process could be greatly improved by using configuration files instead (specifically <a href="http://yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a>). As we have multiple teams working on the BBC News code base and in multiple languages, using configuration files is a much easier and maintainable solution.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into the configuration set-up we use at BBC News. Instead I&rsquo;ll focus on the basic principles of how Presenters work, which is quite simply a case of moving the logic (getting component specific Model data and assigning it to to component specific variables) into separate files called Presenters which you can instantiate within your controller.</p>

<h2 id="code-example">Code Example</h2>

<h3 id="controller-1">Controller</h3>

<p>Here is a basic example in Ruby…</p>

<pre><code>require 'app/presenters/a'
require 'app/presenters/b'

class AboutController &lt; ApplicationController
  get '/' do
    @a = Presenters::A.new
    @b = Presenters::B.new

    title 'About'
    erb :about
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>…in this example we have an &lsquo;About&rsquo; page which is made up of two components <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. As you can see we <code>require</code> the presenters which handle those two components and within our Controller we instantiate the Presenters.</p>

<p>Notice that&rsquo;s all we do. Each Presenter encapsulates the logic needed to prepare the data to be passed to the <code>:about</code> view template.</p>

<h3 id="view-1">View</h3>

<p>Before I show you the Presenter code itself, I&rsquo;ll show you the View template file…</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= @title %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;% if @a.run %&gt;
  &lt;%= partial :&quot;components/a&quot;, { :title =&gt; @a.title, :summary =&gt; @a.summary, :data =&gt; @a.data } %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;% if @b.run %&gt;
  &lt;%= partial :&quot;components/b&quot;, { :name =&gt; @b.name, :age =&gt; @b.age } %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>…as you can see we have very minimal logic in place. If anything I have too much logic in the View as I initially was re-using the same View template over and over and so I wanted to protect again errors appearing when loading a template which referenced a component I wasn&rsquo;t loading, but I&rsquo;ve since changed how my application was working but left the conditional checks in as an example of how code can evolve over time.</p>

<p>We literally just check to see if the component has been initialised (in this case we created a <code>run</code> property we set to <code>true</code> when the component&rsquo;s Presenter is first initialised).</p>

<p>We then render the View for the component and pass through the variables that were set-up from within the Presenter.</p>

<p>Now I can also open up my <code>:home</code> View file and add in the <code>a</code> component there as well just as easily. It would be even easier if I didn&rsquo;t have to manually add the <code>a</code> component to the <code>:home</code> View file but that&rsquo;s where running from configuration files like we do at BBC News would come in handy (but that would have been too complicated an implementation for the sake of such a basic example as required for this post).</p>

<h3 id="presenter">Presenter</h3>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at one of our Presenters, in this case the Presenter for our <code>b</code> component…</p>

<pre><code>require 'app/presenters/base'
require 'app/models/b'

class Presenters::B &lt; Presenters::Base
  attr_reader :run, :name, :age

  def initialize
    @run = true

    model = B.new('Mark', '99')
    prepare_view_data({ :name =&gt; model.name, :age =&gt; model.age })
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>…as you can see we load a specific Model for this component and then generate our View data by passing the Model information through to a <code>prepare_view_data</code> method (see below for the implementation details).</p>

<p>The <code>Base</code> Presenter which our component Presenters inherit from is very straight forward as you can see from the following example…</p>

<pre><code>module Presenters
  class Base
    attr_accessor :model

    def prepare_view_data hash
      hash.each do |name, value|
        instance_variable_set(&quot;@#{name}&quot;, value)
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>…it&rsquo;s just a module namespace with a base class that has a single method <code>prepare_view_data</code> which dynamically generates instance variables based on the data we passed through from the inheriting Presenter class and which then are usable within the View.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it as far as understanding the Presenter pattern. It&rsquo;s a nice clean solution for componentising your different page features and keeping your code more easily maintainable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a repo on GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/Integralist/MVCP" target="_blank">MVCP</a> which is written in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> and uses the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra</a> web framework. Note: I had some help from my colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/sthulb" target="_blank">Simon</a> in cleaning up and refactoring some of the code (it may only have been minor changes but as with all good refactorings it made a massive difference to the quality of the code, so thanks to him for helping out).</p>
