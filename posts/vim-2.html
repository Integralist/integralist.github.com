<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you saw my last post about <a href="http://integralist.co.uk/VIM.html">Vim</a> you&#39;ll see that I&#39;ve started using Vim as my main editor for development work.</p>

<p>But up until this point I had just been whimsically opening files and editing them and I realised quite quickly this wasn&#39;t going to &#39;cut it&#39; in the long run. So I wanted to show you the work flow I&#39;m currently using in my day to day life.</p>

<h2>Starting up</h2>

<p>First thing first, I&#39;ve found the best way to work is to keep things simple (oh wow, that &#39;simple&#39; philosophy just keeps cropping up <em>everywhere</em> doesn&#39;t it, must be a sign! Maybe keeping things simple is the way we should do things. What a novel idea!)</p>

<p>So to achieve this let&#39;s just have two panes open.<br>
One to hold our code and one to handle our terminal.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll look something like this…</p>

<div class="delayed-image-load" data-src="/images/generated/Vim-TwoPane-1024.png" data-width="1024"></div>

<p>The idea being: in my Vim pane I can then split into two panes if I really need to, like so…</p>

<div class="delayed-image-load" data-src="/images/generated/Vim-ThreePane-1024.png" data-width="1024"></div>

<p>But anything more than that then you&#39;ll want to open a new tmux window as otherwise you have too much going on.</p>

<p>To do this I run the following commands…</p>

<ol>
<li><code>tmux</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-b</code> (or whatever your tmux prefix command is) and then <code>Shift-&quot;</code> (to create a horizontal split pane)</li>
<li>In the bottom pane I&#39;ll <code>cd</code> into whatever directory my project is</li>
<li>Then in the bottom pane we&#39;ll run <code>Ctrl-b</code> and type <code>:resize-pane -D 5</code>** to change the height of the bottom pane</li>
<li>In the top panel I&#39;ll run <code>vim</code></li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>**if I&#39;m on a large screen and not my laptop then I&#39;ll change the value from 5 to 10</p>

<h2>Top Pane</h2>

<p>So as I said, the top pane is there literally to just run Vim. But because I use the <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">Ctrl-P</a> plugin and Vim has been opened from the root directory of my project, I can just run a fuzzy file search using Ctrl-P to easily open up any file in my project work space. So I don&#39;t need lots of panes open as I can just keep jumping around my files really easily with fuzzy searching.</p>

<p>If for whatever reason I feel I need another file open side by side then I&#39;ll run tmux&#39;s prefix command followed by <code>Shift-5</code> to create a vertical split pane, where I can then run <code>vim</code> and again use my fuzzy file search to locate the file I want.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t open any more panes than that (3 max).</p>

<h2>What if there isn&#39;t enough space to work in one of the panes?</h2>

<p>Just make the pane you&#39;re currently working in full screen by running <code>Ctrl-b</code> then <code>z</code>. Just run that same command again to go back to the normal pane size.</p>

<h2>What if you need more than three panes?</h2>

<p>If I do need more than three panes then I&#39;ll just open up a new tmux window. No point over loading the screen unnecessarily. Why make your life difficult, that&#39;s what windows are there for!</p>

<h2>Why not just use Vim panes?</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t use Vim&#39;s own panes. I prefer tmux&#39;s. </p>

<p>There are two reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I used Vim&#39;s own panes exclusively (so all 3 panes were Vim panes) then I couldn&#39;t have the terminal running in the bottom pane. Yes I can run terminal commands either in Vim (or suspend Vim) but this isn&#39;t as nice as having a proper terminal screen running freely in the bottom pane.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, if I open Vim in my top pane and then decide to create a vertical split, the file in the right side <em>has</em> to be handled by Vim. I can&#39;t just split the top pane in two and do what I want in the top right pane.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Downsides to using tmux panes?</h2>

<p>~~Yes, there is one downside to using tmux&#39;s panes which I can&#39;t seem to work around, and that is my speed is restricted.~~</p>

<p>~~By that I mean: if I move to another pane I have to wait a fraction of a second before I can use my arrow keys (or <code>hjkl</code> keys) as tmux will try to move me back to the other pane again.~~</p>

<p>~~That can be frustrating, but I&#39;m learning to live with it.~~</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> there is a solution!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason this happens is because the default bindings for the arrow keys are setup with <code>bind-key -r</code>, specifying that they may be repeated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to resolve the issue you re-bind the keys without <code>-r</code>:</p>

<p><code>
bind-key Up    select-pane -U
bind-key Down  select-pane -D
bind-key Left  select-pane -L
bind-key Right select-pane -R
</code></p>

<h2>Buffer lists</h2>

<p>In my Vim pane, as I use the CtrlP plugin to open up multiple files, I&#39;m able to jump between files really easily using its <code>:CtrlPBuffer</code> command, but I make this command quicker to access by configuring Vim to let me access the <code>:CtrlPBuffer</code> using the shortcut <code>&lt;leader&gt;y</code> (the <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> key is a similar concept to the <code>&lt;prefix&gt;</code> key in tmux).</p>

<p>So if I want to jump back to a recently opened file then I&#39;ll just run the command <code>\y</code> (by default the <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> key is a backslash <code>\</code>) and this will show me CtrlP&#39;s buffer list.</p>

<p>Once we have the buffer list open we can just select the file we want to re-open. This makes it really quick for jumping back and forth between two or more files we happen to be editing a lot.</p>

<p>You can configure your <code>.vimrc</code> file to use this shortcut like so: <code>map &lt;leader&gt;y :CtrlPBuffer&lt;cr&gt;</code></p>

<h2>Mapping NERDTree</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t use NERDTree very often but when I do it&#39;s tedious so I mapped <code>map &lt;leader&gt;&#39; :NERDTreeToggle</code> so it&#39;s a lot less annoying to open and close it.</p>

<h2>Global find and replace using Ack</h2>

<p>I like to use the <a href="https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim">Ack plugin</a> for carrying out a global &#39;find and replace&#39; function on my files.</p>

<p>Ack is the same concept as Grep (e.g. use either a string or a Regular Expression to find a match in a list of files). But Ack has been written to be much faster than Grep**.</p>

<p>**Technically, in the background (configured within my <code>.vimrc</code> file), I alias the <code>Ack</code> command within Vim so it uses <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher</a> instead, which has the same API as Ack but is blazingly fast (even more so than Ack!).</p>

<p>To use the plugin you simple run <code>:Ack &#39;pattern&#39; directory</code> (note: if you leave off the directory then the plugin will use the current directory).</p>

<p>Note: when you use the plugin Vim will show the results inside of a <code>Quickfix</code> pane. Navigating this pane requires a few extra commands…</p>

<ul>
<li><code>o</code> = opens the file (and puts focus on that pane)</li>
<li><code>go</code> = quick preview of the file instead (so you stay inside of the Quickfix pane)</li>
<li><code>:copen</code> = if the Quickfix pane is still open and you&#39;re not focused on it, then this command puts your focus back to that pane so you can look at the rest of the results</li>
<li><code>:ccl</code> = closes the Quickfix pane</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much all there is to it (at the moment). If things change then I&#39;ll be sure to update this post but simplicity is the key.</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts and how <em>you</em> do things. I&#39;m interested to know how other Vim users work.</p>
