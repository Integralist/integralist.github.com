<h1 id="survivor-series-1988">Survivor Series 1988</h1>

<p class="strapline">When Five on Five Meant Fifteen Guys at Ringside</p>

<p><span class="image main half"><img src="../../assets/images/survivor-88.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

<p>Ah, <em>Survivor Series 1988</em>—the event where you could witness five-man teams
awkwardly try to coexist for more than five minutes without someone betraying
someone else. This was WWF in the late ‘80s, where the drama was bigger than the
hair, and the matches were so overstuffed with wrestlers, you’d be forgiven for
thinking you’d tuned into a royal rumble by mistake. Grab your spandex and
mullet, because we’re diving into the madness.</p>

<h2 id="the-build-up-if-we-re-friends-now-we-won-t-be-by-the-end">The Build-Up: If We’re Friends Now, We Won’t Be By the End</h2>

<p>The 1988 Survivor Series was all about alliances. Alliances between men who had
spent the previous months body-slamming each other and were now expected to
suddenly get along for&hellip; reasons. Spoiler alert: they didn&rsquo;t. At least not for
long. But, hey, it’s Thanksgiving—what better way to celebrate than watching 40
guys hit each other in the face for your entertainment?</p>

<h3 id="1-team-ultimate-warrior-the-most-electric-group-of-misfits-ever-assembled">1. <strong>Team Ultimate Warrior: The Most Electric Group of Misfits Ever Assembled</strong></h3>

<p>Leading this team was <strong>The Ultimate Warrior</strong>, a man who sprinted to the ring
like he was being chased by a horde of angry turkeys. The Warrior was joined by
<strong>Brutus &ldquo;The Barber&rdquo; Beefcake</strong> (yes, the guy whose gimmick was cutting hair),
<strong>Sam Houston</strong> (because every Survivor Series team needs a guy no one
remembers), <strong>The Blue Blazer</strong> (Owen Hart in a superhero suit, RIP), and <strong>Jim
Brunzell</strong> (one half of the Killer Bees, now a Bee-less hero).</p>

<p>Across the ring stood <strong>The Honky Tonk Man</strong>, the Elvis impersonator with a
guitar and a haircut that defied the laws of physics, <strong>Ron Bass</strong> (because
nothing says intimidating like a cowboy gimmick), <strong>Danny Davis</strong> (who was more
famous for being a crooked referee than an actual wrestler), <strong>Greg &ldquo;The Hammer&rdquo;
Valentine</strong> (known for his slow, plodding matches), and the always-angry <strong>Bad
News Brown</strong>.</p>

<p>This match was everything you could expect from the late &lsquo;80s. Honky Tonk&rsquo;s hair
held up like a champ, and Bad News Brown, not interested in any team-building
exercises, peaced out halfway through the match like he had better things to do.
The Ultimate Warrior went full berserker mode, eliminating everyone like he was
clearing a buffet, leaving Brutus Beefcake free to give everyone an unwanted
trim backstage. The Warrior, of course, won, and sprinted back to the locker
room faster than anyone could question the sanity of his war paint.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-tag-team-mega-collision-too-many-guys-not-enough-referees">2. <strong>The Tag Team Mega-Collision: Too Many Guys, Not Enough Referees</strong></h3>

<p>This match was an absolute <em>tag team</em> frenzy. We had the <strong>Powers of Pain</strong>
(Warlord and Barbarian, two guys who looked like they got lost on their way to a
Conan audition), the <strong>Rockers</strong> (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty, the latter
not yet famous for being thrown through a barber shop window), the <strong>British
Bulldogs</strong> (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid, the toughest Brits this side of a
pub fight), the <strong>Hart Foundation</strong> (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart, half-speeding
toward legendary status), and the <strong>Young Stallions</strong> (Paul Roma and Jim
Powers—yes, they existed). What a hero&rsquo;s lineup.</p>

<p>They were up against the villains: <strong>Demolition</strong> (Ax and Smash, whose face
paint had more character development than some wrestlers), the <strong>Brain Busters</strong>
(Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard, the technical wizards who were there to
actually wrestle), <strong>The Bolsheviks</strong> (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov, token
Cold War-era bad guys), the <strong>Fabulous Rougeaus</strong> (two Canadian brothers
pretending to love America for some reason), and the <strong>Conquistadors</strong> (Uno and
Dos, the most creatively named luchadors ever).</p>

<p>In a match with this many bodies, things got messy. Mr. Fuji, who was managing
Demolition at the time, decided to pull a soap opera-worthy turn by ditching his
team and siding with the Powers of Pain mid-match, because why not? After
approximately 70 minutes of tagging in and out, the Powers of Pain and their new
buddy Fuji stood tall. Demolition probably went backstage to question their life
choices, while everyone else was too busy trying to figure out how they were
supposed to keep track of so many eliminations.</p>

<h3 id="3-team-andré-the-bigger-they-are-the-slower-they-move">3. <strong>Team André: The Bigger They Are, the Slower They Move</strong></h3>

<p>Team captain <strong>André the Giant</strong>, who by this point had all the mobility of a
parked car, led the charge. Backing him up were <strong>Rick Rude</strong> (the most
ab-obsessed man in wrestling), <strong>Dino Bravo</strong> (the master of &ldquo;meh&rdquo;), <strong>&ldquo;Mr.
Perfect&rdquo; Curt Hennig</strong> (who <em>was</em> perfect), and <strong>Harley Race</strong> (the kind of guy
who looked like he smoked cigars while bodyslamming people).</p>

<p>They were up against the ragtag crew of <strong>Hacksaw Jim Duggan</strong> (the king of the
2x4), <strong>Jake &ldquo;The Snake&rdquo; Roberts</strong> (a man who believed in snake therapy),
<strong>Scott Casey</strong> (random cowboy #2), <strong>Ken Patera</strong> (Olympic strongman turned pro
wrestler), and <strong>Tito Santana</strong> (a reliable workhorse, still cashing in on the
success of his flying forearm).</p>

<p>André did his usual thing: stand in the middle of the ring, look menacing, and
let everyone else do the heavy lifting. Jake Roberts brought his trusty snake,
but this time, the snake wasn’t enough to scare André, because André was too
busy contemplating his next nap. After plenty of chaos, it was <strong>Mr. Perfect</strong>
who pulled out the win for his team, probably because he was the only one whose
bones weren’t creaking by the end of the match. Duggan was likely still waving
his 2x4, regardless of the outcome.</p>

<h3 id="4-the-mega-powers-vs-the-twin-towers-can-you-feel-the-ego">4. <strong>The Mega Powers vs. The Twin Towers: Can You Feel the Ego?</strong></h3>

<p>Here it is, folks—the main event, starring two of the biggest egos in wrestling
history. On one side, you had the <strong>Mega Powers</strong>, a tag team consisting of
<strong>Hulk Hogan</strong> (whose flexing could power a small city) and <strong>&ldquo;Macho Man&rdquo; Randy
Savage</strong> (who cut promos like he drank three pots of coffee before the show).
Joining them were <strong>Hercules</strong> (who had a chain, because why not?), <strong>Koko B.
Ware</strong> (accompanied by his parrot Frankie, who was possibly the smartest member
of the team), and <strong>Hillbilly Jim</strong> (yes, a real character who wore overalls to
wrestle).</p>

<p>Their opponents? The fearsome <strong>Twin Towers</strong>: <strong>Akeem</strong> (the former One Man
Gang, now repackaged as a &ldquo;Jive Soul Bro&rdquo; for&hellip; reasons) and <strong>The Big Boss
Man</strong> (who was basically a walking “bad cop” trope). They were joined by <strong>Ted
DiBiase</strong> (the Million Dollar Man, who may or may not have paid his teammates to
like him), <strong>King Haku</strong> (the guy who could kick your head off), and <strong>The Red
Rooster</strong> (yes, a guy pretending to be a rooster).</p>

<p>The match itself? Pure &lsquo;80s insanity. Hogan and Savage kept things together long
enough to win, but the real drama was between them, with Miss Elizabeth stuck in
the middle. Hogan hugged Elizabeth one too many times, and you could practically
see the steam coming out of Savage’s ears. This wasn’t just a win—it was the
start of the <em>end</em> for the Mega Powers. The seeds were planted, and soon enough,
WrestleMania V would come calling, where friendship and loyalty would be thrown
out the window in favor of bicep poses and elbow drops.</p>

<h2 id="the-aftermath-alliances-betrayals-and-nostalgia-in-spandex">The Aftermath: Alliances, Betrayals, and Nostalgia in Spandex</h2>

<p>Survivor Series 1988 was more than just a collection of chaotic matches—it was a
masterclass in building storylines that would simmer for months. Alliances
formed that night didn’t just fade; they exploded spectacularly. The biggest, of
course, was the beginning of the end for the Mega Powers. Hulk Hogan’s habit of
stealing Miss Elizabeth’s attention wasn’t just Savage’s problem—it was
<em>everyone’s</em> problem. Soon enough, their bromance would crumble into a
full-blown rivalry, all thanks to one too many inappropriate side-hugs. And
while Hogan&rsquo;s ego was indestructible, Savage’s paranoia was more than enough to
make WrestleMania V appointment viewing.</p>

<p>Then there was Mr. Fuji’s betrayal of Demolition, a classic bit of heel manager
backstabbing that would leave Ax and Smash with trust issues for years. Fuji’s
sudden affection for the Powers of Pain didn’t make a lot of sense, but it set
the stage for a big showdown down the line—because nothing says grudge match
quite like betrayal in a tag team elimination match that featured more mullets
than actual pins.</p>

<p>And what about poor André the Giant? By this point, his in-ring days were
nearing their end, but he still loomed large over the roster, both literally and
figuratively. Jake &ldquo;The Snake&rdquo; Roberts may have survived, but you just <em>know</em>
André was planning a snake-related revenge at some point. Sure, he wasn’t as
mobile as he once was, but when you’re 7-foot-4, you don’t need to be—you just
glare and wait for people to come to you.</p>

<h2 id="the-legacy-why-we-keep-coming-back-to-1988">The Legacy: Why We Keep Coming Back to 1988</h2>

<p>What makes <em>Survivor Series 1988</em> so memorable, aside from the mullets, neon
tights, and excessive use of hairspray? It’s that perfect mix of over-the-top
characters and the most dramatic, soap opera-esque storytelling you could ask
for. The action wasn’t always crisp, but the personalities more than made up for
it. These were <em>superheroes</em> in a world of villains, where betrayal was
inevitable, and victory usually meant an elbow drop or three.</p>

<p>Sure, wrestling has changed a lot since then. But there’s something about these
early events that makes you smile. It was simpler, more over-the-top, and
honestly? That’s what made it magical. No matter how many times you watch Hogan
flex, Savage scream, or André just stand there looking like a mountain with
legs, you still feel the joy of a bygone era. An era where the lines between
good and evil were drawn with thick, black Sharpie—and usually a folding chair.</p>

<p>It’s wrestling like this that reminds us why we fell in love with the sport in
the first place. Sure, the business has evolved, but sometimes you just want to
go back to when things were simpler. When all you needed was a good guy, a bad
guy, and 30 minutes of controlled chaos. And no event delivered that better than
Survivor Series 1988.</p>

<p>We may never get another event quite like it, but that’s okay. Because even
today, when you go back and rewatch it, you can still feel the magic. And for
wrestling fans, that’s all that matters.</p>
