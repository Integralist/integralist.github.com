## Introduction

One of the key components to a happy development workflow is to ensure your tools work hard for you, are efficient and also fun to use (although sadly that latter point is sorely underappreciated as a deciding factor into what tools you choose). 

This is where configuring your own setup to suit your individual needs becomes essential.

Now although you and I may differ as to what we like, there will inevitably be some common tools and solutions that we'll use and build upon. So what I present here today are are my tools. My configuration and enhancements of those core tools and what I feel to be 'good enough' to suit my needs.

Feel free to take whatever you like and leave the rest.

So what will I be covering? Good question, the running order of things will be: 

- Bash
- Vim
- Tmux

I'll be going over my terminal/shell configurations, as well as my current Vim and tmux setup. So let's get started...

> Note: it shouldn't matter too much, but I'm running Mac OS X

<div id="2"></div>
## Bash

The reason for using Bash over another shell, such as [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) (which I used to use), is primarily its ubiquitousness. I find that whenever I'm writing shell scripts I'll end up using a feature that isn't supported in Bash. 

Obviously this is fine if you're writing shell scripts for your own machine, but I sometimes write scripts for other environments (e.g. continuous integration systems) and they will mostly be running Bash only.

The reasons other people prefer shells like Zsh or Fish (or whatever) is that you get additional features much more easily. But as you'll see shortly, I've configured my Bash environment to provide some of these features, and OK maybe sometimes it's not as slick as other shells; but this is the first - of possibly many - situations where I'm happy with the setup and feel it's "good enough" to suit my needs, but you might disagree (c'est la vie).

I've decided to break this section down into sub parts to make easier to digest:

- [Install terminal theme](#3)
- [Install a newer version of Bash](#4)
- [Configure `~/.bash_profile`](#5)
- [Configure `~/.bashrc`](#6)
- [Configure `~/.inputrc`](#7)
- [Other dotfiles?](#8)

<div id="3"></div>
### Install terminal theme

Now although not strictly anything to do with the shell, I thought it was worth mentioning that I have a few different Terminal themes that I use and choose from. You can find a few of those themes here:

[github.com/integralist/dotfiles](https://github.com/Integralist/dotfiles/tree/master/terminal-themes)

> Note: currently using Smyck

To install them, download the `.terminal` file you want and double click on it.

<div id="4"></div>
### Install a newer version of Bash

I like to install a newer version of Bash via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

For example, execute the following command to see your current Bash version:

<!--language-bash-->

    /bin/bash --version

When you do, you'll likely find Mac OS X comes with a much older version of Bash than you'd expect.

For me I see version `3.2.57`.

So first things first, I want to install a newer version of Bash:

<!--language-bash-->

    brew install bash

Next add the location of this new Bash shell to our system's list of known shells:

<!--language-bash-->

    echo /usr/local/bin/bash | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

Finally, let's tell our system to permanently change to the new Bash shell:

<!--language-bash-->

    chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

OK, at this point if you open a new terminal you'll be using the new Bash shell you've downloaded:

<!--language-bash-->

    bash --version

You'll notice I didn't specify the full path, I just used `bash` and the terminal was able to locate the new installation. Doing this for me tells me the new version of Bash is `4.3.42`.

<div id="5"></div>
### Configure `~/.bash_profile`

In order for the terminal to pick up my actual user configuration for Bash I needed to modify the file `~/.bash_profile`. The specific change I add to this file is as follows:

<!--language-bash-->

    if [ -f $HOME/.bashrc ]; then
      source ~/.bashrc
      cd .
    fi

What this will do is check if there is a `~/.bashrc` file, and if so 'source' it into the currently running shell.

> Note: `cd .` isn't necessary, I just like using it  
> e.g. each new shell will reset the location back to `$HOME`

One other thing I add to `~/.bash_profile` is the following snippet of code:

<!--language-bash-->

    if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then
      source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
    fi

What this does is load an auto completion script (similar to what you'll find in other shells) so you can type part of a comand, then press `<Tab>` and have the shell autocomplete the rest of the command for you (as well as other types of autocompletion).

The script itself is provided by Homebrew. Hence you'll see we tell the script to look inside the Homebrew source directory (e.g. `$(brew --prefix)`), which typically will be something like `/usr/local`.

<div id="6"></div>
### Configure `~/.bashrc`

The `~/.bashrc` file is the main container of our configuration. It'll determine things like the appearance of the shell's prompt, keybindings for moving the cursor around, how we handle the shell's history and many other things.

I'm going to just leave this whole file here and let the comments speak for themselves...

All things considered, this covers a lot of ground for me. There's just one other piece I like to utilise...

<div id="7"></div>
### Configure `~/.inputrc`

In the `~/.inputrc` file I have two lines of configuration only:

<!--language-bash-->

    TAB: menu-complete
    "\e[Z": "\e-1\C-i"

In short, what this gives you is the ability to press `<C-n>` and `<C-p>` to tab back and forth through any ambigious autocompletion suggestions that you may be presented with.

<div id="8"></div>
### Other dotfiles?

My `$HOME` directory is littered with miscellaneous dotfiles such as:

- `.agignore`
- `.gitignore`
- `.gitignore_global`
- `.rspec`

...and many many more (inc dot folders such as `.git`, `.ssh` and `.irssi` etc)

I'm not going to bother to document them all here though.

<div id="9"></div>
## Vim

I've written a book about Vim ([Pro Vim](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-Vim-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484202511/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1417554324&sr=8-1&keywords=pro+Vim)). I've also written about it on my own site quite a few times so I won't waste time explaining it to any one. 

So I'll assume you're already a Vim user and are just interested in my set-up.

One key aspect of using Vim are plugins and so any serious Vim user will need a way to manage their plugins. In my book I cover the in's and out's of [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and since then I moved back to [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as I wanted an abstraction to help me better manage my growing list of plugins.

I've since now moved over to [Voom](https://github.com/airblade/voom) which is a simple Bash script that has a dependency on Pathogen (itself ~300 lines of VimL code). This is, to me at least, a vast improvement on the ~1k lines of VimL for Vundle and I get a simple `voom` command I can use to install/delete/update my plugins via the use of a plugin manifest file.

The Voom plugin manifest file is `~/dotvim/plugin` and, for me, has the following content that defines the plugins I like to use (the configuration of these plugins can be found within the `~/.vimrc` file, which I'll show to you shortly):

<!--language-bash-->

    chriskempson/vim-tomorrow-theme
    ekalinin/Dockerfile.vim
    ervandew/supertab
    fatih/vim-go
    godlygeek/tabular
    guns/vim-clojure-highlight
    guns/vim-clojure-static
    guns/vim-sexp
    kana/vim-textobj-user
    kien/ctrlp.vim
    kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim
    m-kat/aws-vim
    mileszs/ack.vim
    nelstrom/vim-textobj-rubyblock
    othree/html5.vim
    plasticboy/vim-markdown
    scrooloose/syntastic
    sheerun/vim-polyglot
    Shougo/unite.vim
    Shougo/vimfiler.vim
    tpope/vim-commentary
    tpope/vim-endwise
    tpope/vim-fireplace
    tpope/vim-leiningen
    tpope/vim-repeat
    tpope/vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people
    tpope/vim-surround
    vim-scripts/Gist.vim
    vim-scripts/camelcasemotion

> Note: `voom edit` will open the file for you

Right. Let's now look at getting Vim setup. Below is a break-down of 'from nothing, to something':

<!--language-bash-->

    cd ~/
    mkdir -p dotvim/{autoload,bundle}
    touch dotvim/plugins
    ln -nfs ~/dotvim ~/.vim
    curl -LSso ~/dotvim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim

The above snippet of code creates a `dotvim` directory and then downloads Pathogen into it. We symlink the directory to `~/.vim` so when we start up Vim it'll actually pick up the `~/dotvim` directory.

From here we need to create a `~/.vimrc` configuration file and add the following content to it:

<!--language-bash-->

    execute pathogen#infect()
    syntax on
    filetype plugin indent on

This simply gets Pathogen running whenever Vim starts up.

Now we need to get the Voom plugin manager installed. To do that you'll need to run the following command:

<!--language-bash-->

    git clone git@github.com:airblade/voom.git ~/dotvim/voom

As you can see we stick Voom into a `~/dotvim/voom` directory, which has a script you'll need to add into your `$PATH` in order to gain access to the `voom` command. So you may have noticed earlier in our `.bashrc` file we had the following setting:

<!--language-bash-->

    export PATH=$HOME/Projects/golang/bin/:$HOME/dotvim/voom:$PATH

> Note: for NeoVim support  
> `ln -nfs ~/dotvim ~/.nvim`

The configuration for these plugins are placed into my`~/.vimrc` file (shown below) along with all my other Vim settings. Again, I won't bother to detail every single item in my `~/.vimrc`; hopefully the comments will suffice. Otherwise Google anything you're unsure about:

If you need to support NeoVim then you'll want to create a `~/.nvimrc` file and give it one line of content:

<!--language-bash-->

    source ~/.vimrc

## Tmux

As far as tmux is concerned, my `~/.tmux.conf` is relatively short/concise compared to my other configuration files and to other config files I've seen shared online. 

I no longer bother to style the tmux panel, I prefer minimalism nowadays. This means my tmux settings generally revolve around key binding abstractions (although some minor tweaks here and there).

So one last time, just to repeat myself, I don't go into detail as to what these configurations mean; if the comments don't give you the answer you need, then a cursory Google should reveal all you need:

<!--language-bash-->

    # Remap prefix
    unbind C-b
    set -g prefix C-Space

    # Quick key for moving back to the previous window
    bind-key L last-window

    # Vim style bindings for pane movement
    bind-key -r h select-pane -L
    bind-key -r j select-pane -D
    bind-key -r k select-pane -U
    bind-key -r l select-pane -R

    # Fix issue with tmux repeating -r the arrow directions (meaning when you switch panes you can accidentally jump back to the other pane again)
    bind-key Up    select-pane -U
    bind-key Down  select-pane -D
    bind-key Left  select-pane -L
    bind-key Right select-pane -R

    # Make resizing panes easier
    bind-key < resize-pane -L 5
    bind-key > resize-pane -R 5
    bind-key + resize-pane -U 5
    bind-key - resize-pane -D 5
    bind-key = select-layout even-vertical
