# Engineering and Tech Recommended Reading List

I've long kept a list of books I've enjoyed reading, and decided I would share them as a blog post so others could benefit from their learnings.

> Note: I generally keep the [original gist](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/77877126a0b13766f0de) the most up-to-date.
