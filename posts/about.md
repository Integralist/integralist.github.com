Hi there, my name is Mark and I currently work at the BBC as a technical lead and principal software engineer for their responsive news frameworks team. Our goal is to move BBC News (and related products) from their current stack to a cloud based infrastructure via a microservice platform architecture and built using different languages, such as Go and Ruby.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/integralist) and [GitHub](https://github.com/integralist) talking about different technical subjects:

- OOP and FP
- Go, Ruby, Clojure and other languages
- Problems around concurrency and learning about distributed systems

I'm a published author of three books (two through Apress and one self-published via Leanpub):

- [Pro Vim](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-Vim-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484202511/ref=sr_1_1)
- [tmux Taster](http://www.amazon.co.uk/tmux-Taster-Mark-McDonnell-ebook/dp/B00OPTU7LY/ref=sr_1_1)
- [Programming in Clojure](https://leanpub.com/programming-clojure/)

I've won the following awards whilst working at BBC News:

- Best Public Relations of 2014
- Most innovative use of Technology 2014 (team award)
- Developer of the Year 2013
