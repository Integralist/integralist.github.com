Introduction This post isn&amp;rsquo;t about Functional Programming per se, as there are many parts to pure FP (seen in Lisp, Clojure, Haskell etc) which we can&amp;rsquo;t achieve completely in the JavaScript language (for example, implementing fundamental principles of FP such as &amp;ldquo;immutable data&amp;rdquo; is very difficult in a language designed around allowing data structures to be mutable.</description>
