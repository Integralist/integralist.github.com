              <h1>Royal Rumble 1990</h1>
              <p>The Event Where Everything (and Nothing) Happened</p>
            </header>
            <span class="image main"><img src="../images/rumble-90.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            <p>The Royal Rumble of 1990 was everything you'd expect from WWF in this glorious era. It was over-the-top, chaotic, and sprinkled with enough mullets and outrageous fashion to make even the most seasoned wrestling fans cringe with joy. Let's dive into this wild ride, match by match, and embrace the glorious absurdity that was the Royal Rumble 1990.</p>
            <h2>Paul Roma vs. The Brooklyn Brawler (Dark Match)</h2>
            <p>Before the main card kicked off, the fans in attendance got to witness the legendary (okay, maybe that's a stretch) Paul Roma square off against The Brooklyn Brawler in a dark match. Ah, the Brawler — the man who made losing an art form. Roma pulled off the victory, not that anyone noticed or even remembered five minutes later. It was the warm-up act that screamed, "We’re setting the bar low, folks, so you can only go up from here!"</p>
            <h2>The Bushwhackers vs. The Fabulous Rougeaus (with Jimmy Hart)</h2>
            <p>Next, we had The Bushwhackers — the masters of unorthodox, bizarre offense — facing off against The Fabulous Rougeaus, who were more "fabulous" in their matching outfits than in their chances of winning this match. Jacques and Raymond did their best to keep things classy with their French-Canadian charm, but let's be honest: they were no match for the licking, arm-swinging mayhem that Luke and Butch brought to the ring. The Bushwhackers bumbled and stumbled their way to victory in a match that was about as technical as a barroom brawl... and somehow even more entertaining.</p>
            <h2>Brutus Beefcake vs. The Genius (Double Disqualification)</h2>
            <p>Oh, what a spectacle. Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake, with his clippers and obsession with hair, took on The Genius, whose poetic insults were as sharp as his airbrushed robes. This match was a collision of style and substance — except, it had no substance. It ended in a double disqualification because, of course, it did. You can’t have two titans of nonsense clashing without it devolving into chaos. Beefcake tried to give The Genius a haircut post-match, and while he didn’t succeed, he did solidify his reputation as the WWF’s own Edward Scissorhands.</p>
            <h2>Ronnie Garvin vs. Greg Valentine (with Jimmy Hart)</h2>
            <p>Now, here’s a match for the purists. Ronnie Garvin and Greg "The Hammer" Valentine put on a hard-hitting slugfest that had fans wondering if they were watching a wrestling match or an attempt to break every bone in their bodies. This wasn’t about high-flying antics or fancy maneuvers; it was about Garvin and Valentine pounding each other into oblivion. After what felt like an eternity of stiff chops and leg locks, Garvin picked up the win, leaving "The Hammer" to regroup and, presumably, seek medical attention for his battered limbs. A true 'wrestling clinic' for those who enjoy watching two guys clobber each other until one falls down.</p>
            <h2>Jim Duggan vs. Big Boss Man (with Slick) - Disqualification</h2>
            <p>Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Big Boss Man... oh boy, this was the collision of America’s finest: a 2x4-wielding patriot and a nightstick-swinging lawman. It was a bout filled with shouts of "HOOOO!" and, of course, Duggan's trusty piece of lumber. The match had everything you'd expect: brawling, taunting, and Duggan’s trademark goofy grin. It ended in a disqualification, because why not? Apparently, following rules just isn’t Duggan’s style. Boss Man may have lost the match, but he kept his pride... and his nightstick, which, let’s be real, was probably the real winner here.</p>
            <h2>The Royal Rumble Match: Hulk Hogan Stands Tall... Again</h2>
            <p>Now, the moment we’ve all been waiting for: the Royal Rumble itself! Thirty men entered, each one trying to toss the others over the top rope while finding time to throw in a flex or two. There were epic showdowns, unexpected alliances, and a fair share of backstabbing. The ring was crowded, the energy was electric, and then, like the tide rolling in, here came Hulk Hogan. You could almost hear the theme song: "I am a real American..."</p>
            <p>One by one, Hogan eliminated opponents with ease, even tossing out people who were technically still posing after their entrances. The final showdown saw Hogan squaring off with Mr. Perfect, who, to his credit, tried to steal the spotlight with his flawless dropkicks and arrogant smirk. But it was all for naught. With a mighty toss, Hogan sent Perfect flying over the ropes and into the annals of Rumble history. Hogan then posed and flexed for the crowd, because of course, this wasn’t just about winning; it was about reminding everyone that he was the one and only, larger-than-life hero of the WWF.</p>
            <h2>The Aftermath: Nostalgia Wrapped in Madness</h2>
            <p>Royal Rumble 1990 was a perfect snapshot of WWF’s golden era. It had everything: wild characters, disqualifications galore, and more flexing than a Gold's Gym commercial. And sure, it’s easy to poke fun at the absurdities, but that's part of the charm. Wrestling wasn’t about strict rules or technical prowess back then; it was about heart, spectacle, and the sheer thrill of seeing who would come out on top.</p>
            <p>Hogan’s victory, Beefcake’s scissors, The Bushwhackers’ antics — they all painted a picture of a time when wrestling was less about corporate scripts and more about characters who were both ridiculous and beloved. And we miss that, don’t we? It was an era where you could be a patriotic lumberjack or a poetic genius and still find yourself center stage, battling it out in front of a crowd that loved every second of it.</p>
            <p>So, let’s raise a metaphorical 2x4 in salute to Royal Rumble 1990, a night when the only thing that mattered was how loud the crowd cheered and how big the personalities clashed. These matches, these moments, they’re etched in our memories not because they were perfect, but because they were a blast. And isn't that what wrestling is all about?</p>
