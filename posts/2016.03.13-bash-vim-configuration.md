## Introduction

One of the key components to a happy development workflow is to ensure your tools work hard for you, are efficient and also fun to use (although sadly that latter point is sorely underappreciated as a deciding factor into what tools you choose). 

This is where configuring your own setup to suit your individual needs becomes essential.

Now although you and I may differ as to what we like, there will inevitably be some common tools and solutions that we'll use and build upon. So what I present here today are are my tools. My configuration and enhancements of those core tools and what I feel to be 'good enough' to suit my needs.

Feel free to take whatever you like and leave the rest.

So what will I be covering? Good question, the running order of things will be: 

- Bash
- Vim
- Tmux

I'll be going over my terminal/shell configurations, as well as my current Vim and tmux setup. So let's get started...

> Note: it shouldn't matter too much, but I'm running Mac OS X

<div id="2"></div>
## Bash

The reason for using Bash over another shell, such as [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) (which I used to use), is primarily its ubiquitousness. I find that whenever I'm writing shell scripts I'll end up using a feature that isn't supported in Bash. 

Obviously this is fine if you're writing shell scripts for your own machine, but I sometimes write scripts for other environments (e.g. continuous integration systems) and they will mostly be running Bash only.

The reasons other people prefer shells like Zsh or Fish (or whatever) is that you get additional features much more easily. But as you'll see shortly, I've configured my Bash environment to provide some of these features, and OK maybe sometimes it's not as slick as other shells; but this is the first - of possibly many - situations where I'm happy with the setup and feel it's "good enough" to suit my needs, but you might disagree (c'est la vie).

I've decided to break this section down into sub parts to make easier to digest:

- [Install terminal theme](#3)
- [Install a newer version of Bash](#4)
- [Configure `~/.bash_profile`](#5)
- [Configure `~/.bashrc`](#6)
- [Configure `~/.inputrc`](#7)
- [Other dotfiles?](#8)

<div id="3"></div>
### Install terminal theme

Now although not strictly anything to do with the shell, I thought it was worth mentioning that I have a few different Terminal themes that I use and choose from. You can find a few of those themes here:

[github.com/integralist/dotfiles](https://github.com/Integralist/dotfiles/tree/master/terminal-themes)

> Update: I'm now using my own custom theme [integralist](https://github.com/Integralist/mac-os-terminal-theme-integralist)

To install them, download the `.terminal` file you want and double click on it.

<div id="4"></div>
### Install a newer version of Bash

I like to install a newer version of Bash via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

For example, execute the following command to see your current Bash version:

<!--language-bash-->

    /bin/bash --version

When you do, you'll likely find Mac OS X comes with a much older version of Bash than you'd expect.

For me I see version `3.2.57`.

So first things first, I want to install a newer version of Bash:

<!--language-bash-->

    brew install bash

Next add the location of this new Bash shell to our system's list of known shells:

<!--language-bash-->

    echo /usr/local/bin/bash | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

Finally, let's tell our system to permanently change to the new Bash shell:

<!--language-bash-->

    chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

OK, at this point if you open a new terminal you'll be using the new Bash shell you've downloaded:

<!--language-bash-->

    bash --version

You'll notice I didn't specify the full path, I just used `bash` and the terminal was able to locate the new installation. Doing this for me tells me the new version of Bash is `4.3.42`.

<div id="5"></div>
### Configure `~/.bash_profile`

In order for the terminal to pick up my actual user configuration for Bash I needed to modify the file `~/.bash_profile`. The specific change I add to this file is as follows:

<!--language-bash-->

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
      source ~/.bashrc
      cd . || exit
    fi

> Note: I use `/usr/bin/env` to identify my new brew installed version of Bash

What this code will do is check if there is a `~/.bashrc` file, and if so 'source' it into the currently running shell.

> Note: `cd .` isn't necessary, I just like using it  
> e.g. each new shell will reset the location back to `$HOME`

One other thing I add to `~/.bash_profile` is the following snippet of code:

<!--language-bash-->

    if [ -f "$(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion" ]; then
      source "$(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion"
    fi

What this does is load an auto completion script (similar to what you'll find in other shells) so you can type part of a comand, then press `<Tab>` and have the shell autocomplete the rest of the command for you (as well as other types of autocompletion).

The script itself is provided by Homebrew. Hence you'll see we tell the script to look inside the Homebrew source directory (e.g. `$(brew --prefix)`), which typically will be something like `/usr/local`.

<div id="6"></div>
### Configure `~/.bashrc`

The `~/.bashrc` file is the main container of our configuration. It'll determine things like the appearance of the shell's prompt, keybindings for moving the cursor around, how we handle the shell's history and many other things.

I'm going to just leave this whole file here and let the comments speak for themselves, but I encourage you to view the [current version in my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/Integralist/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc) as it'll be up to date and include any fixes/tweaks...

All things considered, this covers a lot of ground for me. There's just one other piece I like to utilise...

<div id="7"></div>
### Configure `~/.inputrc`

In the `~/.inputrc` file I have two lines of configuration only:

<!--language-bash-->

    TAB: menu-complete
    "\e[Z": "\e-1\C-i"

In short, what this gives you is the ability to press `<C-n>` and `<C-p>` to tab back and forth through any ambigious autocompletion suggestions that you may be presented with.

<div id="8"></div>
### Other dotfiles?

My `$HOME` directory is littered with miscellaneous dotfiles such as:

- `.agignore`
- `.gitignore`
- `.gitignore_global`
- `.rspec`

...and many many more (inc dot folders such as `.git`, `.ssh` and `.irssi` etc)

I'm not going to bother to document them all here though.

<div id="9"></div>
## Vim

I've written a book about Vim ([Pro Vim](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-Vim-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484202511/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1417554324&sr=8-1&keywords=pro+Vim)). I've also written about it on my own site quite a few times so I won't waste time explaining it to any one. 

So I'll assume you're already a Vim user and are just interested in my set-up.

One key aspect of using Vim are plugins and so any serious Vim user will need a way to manage their plugins. In my book I cover the in's and out's of [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and since then I moved back to [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as I wanted an abstraction to help me better manage my growing list of plugins.

I've since now moved over to [Voom](https://github.com/airblade/voom) which is a simple Bash script that has a dependency on Pathogen (itself ~300 lines of VimL code). This is, to me at least, a vast improvement on the ~1k lines of VimL for Vundle and I get a simple `voom` command I can use to install/delete/update my plugins via the use of a plugin manifest file.

Voom utilises a manifest file (`~/.vim/plugins`) to determine what plugins are installed. Below is the current contents of that file (the configuration for the plugins themselves can be found within the `~/.vimrc` file, which I'll show to you shortly):

<!--language-bash-->

    tpope/vim-surround
    vim-scripts/Gist.vim
    vim-scripts/camelcasemotion

> Note: `voom edit` will open the file for you

Right. Let's now look at getting Vim setup. Below is a break-down of 'from nothing, to something':

<!--language-bash-->

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/{autoload,bundle}
    curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim
    curl -LSso ~/.vim/plugins https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Integralist/dotfiles/master/voom/plugins
    curl -LSso /usr/local/bin/voom https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airblade/voom/master/voom
    chmod 744 /usr/local/bin/voom
    alias voom='VIM_DIR=~/.vim voom'
    curl -LSso ~/.vimrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Integralist/dotfiles/master/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim ~/.config/nvim
    ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
    voom

The above snippet of code creates a `.vim` directory and then downloads Pathogen into it. We symlink the directory to `~/.config/nvim` so when we start up NeoVim it'll actually pick up the `~/.vim` directory. This means both Vim and NeoVim will work from the same set of files.

You'll notice that we clone down my `.vimrc` from GitHub to `~/.vimrc` and then symlink it to `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` so again when we start up NeoVim it'll work just fine. On top of that we've installed Voom (our plugin manager) into a place where my `$PATH` has access to it, and then executed the `voom` command to start installing the plugins defined in the `~/.vim/plugins` file.

Note that in order for our plugins to work with Pathogen, we need the following snippet within our `~/.vimrc`:

<!--language-bash-->

    execute pathogen#infect()
    syntax on
    filetype plugin indent on

This simply sets Pathogen running whenever Vim starts up.

The configuration for all my plugins are placed directly inside my `~/.vimrc` file (shown below) along with all my other Vim settings. Again, I won't bother to detail every single item in my `~/.vimrc`; hopefully the comments will suffice. Otherwise Google anything you're unsure about:

## Tmux

As far as tmux is concerned, my `~/.tmux.conf` is relatively short/concise compared to my other configuration files and to other config files I've seen shared online. 

I no longer bother to style the tmux panel, I prefer minimalism nowadays. This means my tmux settings generally revolve around key binding abstractions (although some minor tweaks here and there).

So one last time, just to repeat myself, I don't go into detail as to what these configurations mean; if the comments don't give you the answer you need, then a cursory Google should reveal all you need:

<!--language-bash-->

    # Remap prefix
    unbind C-b
    set -g prefix C-Space

    # Quick key for moving back to the previous window
    bind-key L last-window

    # Vim style bindings for pane movement
    bind-key -r h select-pane -L
    bind-key -r j select-pane -D
    bind-key -r k select-pane -U
    bind-key -r l select-pane -R

    # Fix issue with tmux repeating -r the arrow directions (meaning when you switch panes you can accidentally jump back to the other pane again)
    bind-key Up    select-pane -U
    bind-key Down  select-pane -D
    bind-key Left  select-pane -L
    bind-key Right select-pane -R

    # Make resizing panes easier
    bind-key < resize-pane -L 5
    bind-key > resize-pane -R 5
    bind-key + resize-pane -U 5
    bind-key - resize-pane -D 5
    bind-key = select-layout even-vertical
    bind-key | select-layout even-horizontal

    # Reload tmux config
    bind-key r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

    # Ensure terminal starts with its own colour scheme (helps Vim/Neovim themes to not break)
    set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

    # Enable UTF8 support
    set-window-option -g utf8 on

    # Use Vi style key bindings to move around copy mode
    setw -g mode-keys vi

    # Make sure messages (using display-message) are displayed for long enough to read
    set-option -g display-time 2000

    # Remove delay when pressing esc in Vim
    set -sg escape-time 0

    # Fix issue with copying from within a tmux session and wanting to paste outside of it
    set -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l '/bin/zsh'"

    # Setup `v` and `y` operators to start and yank selections (like Vim)
    bind-key -t vi-copy 'v' begin-selection
    bind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy" # pbcopy is only available for Mac (not Linux)

    # Prevent tmux from renaming the tab when processes change
    set-option -g allow-rename off

    # Set base index value to one (as apposed to zero)
    set -g base-index 1

    # Increase scrollback lines
    set -g history-limit 30000

    # Renumber windows automatically after removing a window
    # Prevents my OCD and means I don't have to manually run {move|swap}-window
    set-option -g renumber-windows on
