## Introduction

In Ruby, there are three types of methods that can be applied to a class:

1. Instance methods
2. Singleton methods
3. Class methods

The first are available to all "instances" that are created from the class; the second are only available to a specific instance of a class and finally, the last are only available to the class itself.

Let's see an example of each:

<!--language-ruby-->

    # Instance methods

    class Foo
      def speak
        puts "hello"
      end
    end
    
    foo = Foo.new
    bar = Foo.new

    foo.speak # => hello
    bar.speak # => hello

    # Singleton methods

    class Foo; end

    foo = Foo.new
    bar = Foo.new

    def foo.speak
      puts "hello"
    end

    foo.speak # => hello
    bar.speak # => NoMethodError: undefined method `speak' for #<Foo:0x007f97b60c1890>

    # Class methods
    
    class Foo
      def self.speak
        puts "hello"
      end
    end
    
    foo = Foo.new

    foo.speak # => NoMethodError: undefined method `speak' for #<Foo:0x007f97b3af0fa8>
    
    Foo.speak # => hello

The above code (both singleton methods and class methods) demonstrates what is known in the Ruby community as an "Eigenclass". This is effectively an anonymous class that Ruby creates and inserts into the inheritance hierarchy to hold the class methods (thus not interfering with the instances that are created from the class).

Another way of accessing an Eigenclass is with the following syntax (`class <<`):

<!--language-ruby-->

    # Singleton methods

    class Foo; end

    foo = Foo.new

    class << foo
      def speak
        puts "hello"
      end
    end

    foo.speak # => hello

    # Class methods
    
    class Foo
      class << self
        def speak
          puts "hello"
        end
      end
    end
    
    Foo.speak # => hello

## Singleton and Class method visibility

The reason understanding the Eigenclass is important is because it helps to clarify how to make some methods private when they otherwise would seem impossible to make private.

Let's see an example of what I'm referring to:

<!--language-ruby-->

    class Foo
      def self.bar
        p "im public"
      end
      
      private
      def self.baz
        p "im private"
      end
    end
     
    Foo.bar # => im public
    Foo.baz # => im private

Notice that although we've specified `def self.baz` to be `private` it is still accessible directly. This is because `private` only applies to instance methods (where as Singleton/Class methods are instance methods of the Eigenclass).

> Note: `private` is actually a method and not a directive or special syntax.

In the above example the `private` method goes through the `Foo` class, and so its class level methods aren't affected by the `private` method.

Now that we've seen the problem, let's see how to fix this by taking advantage of the Eigenclass:

<!--language-ruby-->

    # Singleton method example

    class Foo; end

    foo = Foo.new

    class << foo
      def speak
        implementation_details
      end

      private

      def implementation_details
        puts "hello!!!"
      end
    end

    foo.speak # => hello!!!
    foo.implementation_details # => NoMethodError: private method `implementation_details' called for #<Foo:0x007f97b43f3920>

    # Class method example

    class Foo
      class << self
          def speak
            implementation_details
          end

          private

          def implementation_details
            puts "hello!!!"
          end
      end
    end
    
    Foo.speak # => hello!!!
    Foo.implementation_details # => NoMethodError: private method `implementation_details' called for Foo:Class

In the above code we're demonstrating how to make some methods public (i.e. `speak`) while keeping other implementation specific functions private (these types of methods we don't want to be public as there is no reason for an end user to call the method directly).

In the above code the `private` method (for both Singleton and Class method examples) goes through the Eigenclass, and as the class methods are technically instance methods on the Eigenclass, so the `private` directive is enforced.

## Meta Programming Version

> Note: thanks to [Peter Cooper](https://twitter.com/peterc) for the following tip

We can utilise a little Ruby meta programming to achieve the same result:

<!--language-ruby-->

    class Foo
      def self.bar
        p "im public"
      end
      
      def self.baz
        p "im private"
      end

      private_class_method :baz
    end
     
    Foo.bar # => im public
    Foo.baz # => NoMethodError: private method `baz' called for Foo:Class
