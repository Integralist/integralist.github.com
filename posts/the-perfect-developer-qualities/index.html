  <p>For me the perfect developer (if there is such a person) has these qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Friendly</strong>: is respected and liked by all they work with and are always approachable (even in times of stress)</li>
<li><strong>Humble</strong>: has great humilty and is not driven by ego</li>
<li><strong>Calm</strong>: doesn&rsquo;t get emotive within discussions (including discussions that are both in their favour and those that aren&rsquo;t)</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>: appreciates that business requirements do change regularly and that there are no perfect scenarios; so is able to adapt to problematic situations in the appropriate manner</li>
<li><strong>Agile</strong>: recognises when they are potentially moving down a rabbit hole/time sink/yak shave and will successfully re-evaluate the situation and refocus their attention</li>
<li><strong>Patient</strong>: appreciates that no dev is born equal and so varying soft/practical skills will be encountered</li>
<li><strong>Experienced</strong>: has a wide ranging skill set with relevant practical experience and most importantly realises the fundamentals of simple code design and recognised patterns</li>
<li><strong>Consistent</strong>: by being consistent in their development approach they faciliate easier rotation of developers when resources are restricted/restructured</li>
<li><strong>Wise</strong>: knows <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> a particular technology is appropriate to use (and when not appropriate)</li>
<li><strong>Analytical</strong>: is pragmatic and can break down complex problems into logical smaller tasks</li>
<li><strong>Articulate</strong>: able to communicate clearly their ideas to people of all technical levels</li>
<li><strong>Open</strong>: continuous documentation and visibility into design and development progress; ensuring good communication</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable</strong>: understands a problem&rsquo;s sense of proportion; what&rsquo;s important and what isn&rsquo;t (e.g. when something is a big deal and worth pressing; and when it isn&rsquo;t and so not prematurely raising red flags)</li>
<li><strong>Passionate</strong>: enjoys their craft; always keen/open to new experiences and learning new things</li>
</ul>
