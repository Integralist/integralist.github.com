## Introduction

I've recently been looking at using netcat and also understanding how SSH tunelling works. In order to play around with tunelling specifically, I needed an environment that I could SSH into (e.g. so I could proxy a connection through to).

My initial thought was to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/examples/running_ssh_service/) and setting it up with an SSH daemon. Annoyingly I couldn't get it to let me SSH into the running Docker container. So due to a lack of time allowance dedicated to this problem, I decided to work around this by using [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/private_network.html) instead.

## Set-up

Now Vagrant automatically sets you up with a `vagrant ssh` command, but I still needed an actual dedicated ip that I could use to SSH into the running Vagrant VM. So the solution requires the following items:

- A `Vagrantfile`
- A custom SSH config file

### Vagrantfile

<!--language-ruby-->

    VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"

    Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
      config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
      config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.50.4"
    end

As you can see, we're building a Ubuntu 14.04.2 VM, and we've defined a private ip address (`192.168.50.4`); although this could be any [private ip range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address#Private_addresses) (e.g. `172.xx.xx.xxx`) instead.

> Note: as noted by [Simon Thulbourn](https://twitter.com/sthulb) 192.168/16 is used more for home/small networks

### SSH Config

<!--language-bash-->

    Host 192.168.50.4
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
      IdentitiesOnly yes
      User vagrant
      IdentityFile /path/to/user/directory/vagrant-ssh/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
      PasswordAuthentication no

> Note: the `IdentityFile` value can be retrieved from `vagrant ssh-config`

## Example

Now we have the set-up in place, we can build the VM:

<!--language-bash-->

    vagrant up --provider virtualbox

Once the VM is created and running we can SSH into the box directly using our defined private ip:

<!--language-bash-->

    ssh -F ./ssh-config vagrant@192.168.50.4
