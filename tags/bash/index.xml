      <description>Memory Management Types of Profiling Tools Matrix Analysis Steps Base Example ReadMemStats Pprof Trace Conclusion  
Memory Management Before we dive into the techniques and tools available for profiling Go applications, we should first understand a little bit about its memory model as this can help us to understand what it is we’re seeing in relation to memory consumption.
Go’s implementation is a parallel mark-and-sweep garbage collector. In the traditional mark-and-sweep model, the garbage collector would stop the program from running (i.</description>

      <description>Introduction How does it work? Comparison Code Explanation Conclusion  
Introduction This is a quick post to demonstrate how I use a simple Bash shell script to report when web pages are failing (e.g. returning a non-200 HTTP status code). It does this by sending notifications of the URL which returned a non-200 status code into a remote application (in my case Slack; but you could modify the script to suit whatever service you happen to be using).</description>

      <description>Introduction Directory Structure Configuration Building Running Verifying Revocation References Conclusion  
Introduction The purpose of this post is to demonstrate how to configure nginx to use client certificates for authenticated access to your back-end service (in this example: a Ruby/Sinatra application).
 Note: the focus of this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about Ruby/Sinatra so don&amp;rsquo;t worry if your back-end service is built with another programming language
 I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into the details of how most of it was set-up, as the majority of this was already documented in a previous blog post here: Setting up nginx with Docker so I recommend reading through that first if you&amp;rsquo;re new to Docker and nginx.</description>

      <description>This post was originally written for David Walsh back in 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ve since decided to reproduce it here for my own records - Integralist: August, 2017.
 Before we get started, it&amp;rsquo;s worth me spending a brief moment introducing myself to you. My name is Mark (or @integralist if Twitter happens to be your communication tool of choice) and I currently work for BBC News in London England as a principal engineer/tech lead; and I&amp;rsquo;m also the author of &amp;ldquo;Pro Vim&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I thought I would get down in a blog post the different Git commands and tips that I find really useful, because every now and then it seems I need to refer back to these notes (which up until this point have been in a txt file in my Dropbox) if I&amp;rsquo;ve not used a particular command in a while.
Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll find them useful too.
