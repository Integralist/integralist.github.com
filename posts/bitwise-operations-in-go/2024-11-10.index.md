# Bitwise Operations in Go

In the below Go file we use bitwise operators to manipulate individual flags (on/off switches) in a single integer, where each bit position represents a different status.

First we'll look at the code, and then we'll explain how it works:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

// Define bit flags as constants, where each status is represented by a unique bit position
const (
	StatusActive   = 1 << iota // 1 << 0 which is 0001 (binary)
	StatusAdmin                // 1 << 1 which is 0010
	StatusBanned               // 1 << 2 which is 0100
	StatusVerified             // 1 << 3 which is 1000
)

// Stringify statuses for easier output
func stringifyStatus(status int) string {
	statuses := []string{}

	if status&StatusActive != 0 {
		statuses = append(statuses, "Active")
	}
	if status&StatusAdmin != 0 {
		statuses = append(statuses, "Admin")
	}
	if status&StatusBanned != 0 {
		statuses = append(statuses, "Banned")
	}
	if status&StatusVerified != 0 {
		statuses = append(statuses, "Verified")
	}

	return strings.Join(statuses, ", ")
}

func main() {
	// Let's create a user status and use bitwise OR to combine different flags

	var userStatus int

	// Set the user as active and verified
	userStatus |= StatusActive | StatusVerified
	fmt.Println("Initial Status:", stringifyStatus(userStatus))

	// Add "Admin" status
	userStatus |= StatusAdmin
	fmt.Println("After adding Admin:", stringifyStatus(userStatus))

	// Remove "Verified" status using bitwise AND with NOT
	userStatus &^= StatusVerified
	fmt.Println("After removing Verified:", stringifyStatus(userStatus))

	// Add "Banned" status
	userStatus |= StatusBanned
	fmt.Println("After adding Banned:", stringifyStatus(userStatus))

	// Check if the user is an admin
	if userStatus&StatusAdmin != 0 {
		fmt.Println("User is an admin.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("User is NOT an admin.")
	}

	// Remove "Admin" status using bitwise AND with NOT
	userStatus &^= StatusAdmin
	fmt.Println("After removing Admin:", stringifyStatus(userStatus))

	// Check if the user is banned
	if userStatus&StatusBanned != 0 {
		fmt.Println("User is banned.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("User is NOT banned.")
	}

	// Check if the user is an admin
	if userStatus&StatusAdmin != 0 {
		fmt.Println("User is an admin.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("User is NOT an admin.")
	}
}
```

## Visualising Bits

In case you need a reminder of a what bit alignment and shifting look like:

## Defining Bit Flags

Each status is assigned a unique power of 2 using bit shifting (`1 << iota`).

This ensures each flag only affects a single bit:

- `StatusActive` has the binary value `0001` (`1 << 0` == 1 in decimal).
- `StatusAdmin` has the binary value `0010` (`1 << 1` == 2 in decimal).
- `StatusBanned` has the binary value `0100` (`1 << 2` == 4 in decimal).
- `StatusVerified` has the binary value `1000` (`1 << 3` == 8 in decimal).

## Setting Statuses

The following example combines two separate status flags:

```
userStatus |= StatusActive | StatusVerified
```

In binary, this results in `1001` (or 9 in decimal), which means both the "active" and "verified" flags are set.

## Adding and Removing Flags

The following example sets the "admin" bit without affecting the other bits, resulting in `1011` (11 in decimal):

```
userStatus |= StatusAdmin
```

## Comparing Statuses

Once `userStatus` has combined flags we can use the `&` operator to perform a bitwise `AND` operation, which means it compares each bit of two integers. For each bit position, if both bits are 1, the result at that position will be 1; otherwise, it will be 0.

So what happens when we compare `userStatus&StatusAdmin != 0`?

Well, `StatusAdmin` is a bit flag defined as `1 << 1`, which results in `0010` in binary. This means that `StatusAdmin` occupies the second bit position in the binary representation of an integer. When we do `userStatus&StatusAdmin`, we're effectively "masking" all bits except for the one represented by StatusAdmin (this is known as **bit masking**).

When we perform `userStatus&StatusAdmin`, we get a result where only the bit corresponding to `StatusAdmin` remains (and is set to `1` if that bit was already set in `userStatus`). If this result is non-zero (`!= 0`), it means the `StatusAdmin` bit is set in `userStatus`. If it's zero, then `StatusAdmin` is not set in `userStatus`.

If we look at the code in `bitwise.go` we'll see `userStatus` is initially set to include `StatusActive` and `StatusVerified`, so `userStatus` is `1001` in binary (which is `9` in decimal). Remember `StatusActive` occupied the first bit position (`0001`), while `StatusVerified` occupied the fourth bit position (`1000`) so if setting both flags we get the combined `1001`.

Next, we add the `StatusAdmin` flag with `userStatus |= StatusAdmin`, making `userStatus` now `1011` in binary (which is 11 in decimal). When we check if `StatusAdmin` is set using `userStatus&StatusAdmin != 0` we get back `2` from `userStatus&StatusAdmin` (which is `0010` in binary) because we've bit masked the other bits that might have been turned on (if you recall, using `&` turns each bit to zero except for those bits that were 1 in both numbers being compared), in order to _reveal_ whether the `StatusAdmin` bit was set on or not (i.e. `0` != `2` so we know this person is an admin).
