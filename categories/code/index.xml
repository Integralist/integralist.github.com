      <description>Introduction Python Go Mounting Volumes  
Introduction You&amp;rsquo;re a software engineer with a new laptop.
You&amp;rsquo;re going to be writing code in multiple languages.
You&amp;rsquo;re going to have projects of varying dependencies.
But you want to avoid the issues you&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past:
 Messy installations of lots of different software packages. Clogging up your system with programming language version managers.  You decide to use Docker.</description>

      <description>Introduction Visual Breakdown Vulnerabilities? Conclusion  
Introduction Just a quick post to cover the key architecture I&amp;rsquo;m using currently. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested to know how others are doing things in the hope that I can improve the security of my setup.
 Note: I&amp;rsquo;m not a security paranoia nut, so I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for the most concrete solution. But definitely want to be sure I&amp;rsquo;m not missing anything obvious either</description>

Introduction I decided recently to read a book on the C programming language. The idea was to learn some more low-level concepts that other higher-level languages were abstracting away from me.
This write up is the result of some of those learnings.</description>

      <description>Syscalls and C This post is aimed at explaining the difference between a system call (provided by the Linux kernal) and a wrapper function that has a similar name within one of the C standard libraries.
I have no formal Computer Science (CS) background, I started programming in 1999 and only from 2016 am I starting to learn the C programming language in order to help give me a deeper knowledge of how *nix systems work and other core CS concepts.</description>

If so, then &amp;ldquo;Pass&amp;rdquo; might be something of interest to you as it offers you the ability to securely store information via the command line interface (e.</description>

      <description>Introduction Install gRPC Install Proto Buffer Compiler Hello World Proto Definition Ruby Example Go Example Conclusion  
Introduction I started designing a new microservice that I wanted to write in Go. The service was to be a JSON RPC service over TCP, and the expected consumer servicer I would build using Ruby.
I had some initial concerns regarding the nature of TCP sockets with a highly scalable and distrubuted set of services (this was to be utilised within the BBC so these are genuine concerns to be had for my purposes) and so I decided to do some research.</description>

      <description>Introduction How does it work? Comparison Code Explanation Conclusion  
Introduction This is a quick post to demonstrate how I use a simple Bash shell script to report when web pages are failing (e.g. returning a non-200 HTTP status code). It does this by sending notifications of the URL which returned a non-200 status code into a remote application (in my case Slack; but you could modify the script to suit whatever service you happen to be using).</description>

      <description>Introduction  Outline Variations Requirements  RPC over HTTP RPC over TCP JSON Calling from Ruby gRPC  
Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by understanding what an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) actually is:
 RPC is a way of connecting two separate services via a raw TCP socket
 
Outline The fundamental principle behind RPC is to create a service that exposes a function behind that service.
The steps typically look something like:</description>

Introduction I wanted to learn about how to use the popular proxy server nginx for handling &amp;ldquo;reverse proxy&amp;rdquo; duties on a Ruby project I was working on. So I decided the easiest thing to do in order to play around with nginx (as I work on a MacBook Pro laptop), would be to install and run it (and my back-end application) within Docker containers.</description>

 Object-Oriented Design is about the messages that get sent between objects and not the objects themselves.
 The reason I felt this quote was important for good code design was because it helped focus our attention on improving our object&amp;rsquo;s interfaces.</description>

      <description>Introduction What they are? How to detect them? When is it OK to modify them?  
Introduction This was intended as a short and overly simplified post about Host methods and Native methods.

What they are? Native methods are built-in functions provided by the ECMAScript core specification. So things like Object methods (e.g. Object.create), Array methods (e.g. Array#forEach) etc.
Host methods are functions provided by the host environment (most of the time when working in web development the host environment will be the user’s web browser).</description>
